            <h2>I am Thomas Turner, a first year Computer Science student with over 2 years of experience developing software projects and a passion for AI/ML. Currently, I am seeking internship roles which work directly in ML
            infrastructure and deployment, as well as backend / full-stack software engineering.</h2>

                <h3>Software Engineering</h2>
                <h4>As well as industrial ML research, I am also interested in large-scale systems which integrate ML services,
                such as automated trading systems, materials analysis, computer vision and medical diagnostics. My personal experience
                is more extensive in the backend, although I have worked with popular JS front-end frameworks (primarily REACT).
                I am skilled in multiple programming languages, currently Rust, C++, Python, Java and Javascript.</h4>

                <h4> I am an aspiring industrial deep learning researcher,
                currently interested in the sub-fields of AI explainability, alignment and value system representation with language, predictive model based 
                reinforcement learning (in the context of autonomous driving applications), as well as steps towards AGI with Bayesian learning on graphical models. Read my <a href="https://www.google.com">blog</a>
                for some of my personal ideas, paper reviews and news.

                <h4>Alongside these aspirations, I have plans to create a brand and suite of accessiblity products
                for neurodivergent individuals. Currently, I am working on an augmented reality system called Label which can
                help those diagnosed with ADHD to improve problems with object permanence, and prevent cognitive overload.
                A prototype of this can be viewed below.</h4>
